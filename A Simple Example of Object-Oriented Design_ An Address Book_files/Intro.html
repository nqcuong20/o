<h2>Use Cases for a Simple Address Book</h2>

<p>
In the following, use cases are listed in the natural order that a user would
think of them.  In the actual File menu, items that correspond to the various
use cases will be listed in the traditional order, which is slightly different.

<h3>Flows of Events for Individual Use Cases</h3>


<div>


<a name="Add">
<hr>

<h4>Add a Person Use Case</h4>

<p>
The Add a Person use case is initiated when the user clicks the "Add" button in the main window.  
A dialog box appears, with title "New Person", containing fields for the user to fill in the
new person's first and last names and other information. The box can be dismissed by clicking 
either "OK" or "Cancel".  If the "OK" button is clicked, a new person is added to the end of the
address book, and the person's name is added to the end of the list of names in the main window.
If the "Cancel" button is clicked, no changes are made either to the address book or to the main window.

</p>





<a name="Edit">
<hr>

<h4>Edit a Person Use Case</h4>

<p>
The Edit a Person use case is initiated when the user either highlights a name in the list of names 
in the main window and then clicks the "Edit" button, or the user double-clicks a name.  In either 
case, a dialog box, with title "Edit person's name", appears containing current information about 
the person selected, (except the person's name, which appears only in the title).   The user can 
then edit the individual fields.  The box can be dismissed by clicking either "OK" or "Cancel".  
If the "OK" button is clicked, the entry in the address book for the selected person is updated to 
reflect any changes made by the user.  If the "Cancel" button is clicked, no changes are made to the 
address book.

<a name="Delete">
<hr>

<h4>Delete a Person Use Case</h4>

<p>
The Delete a Person use case is initiated when the user highlights a name in the list of names
in the main window and then clicks the "Delete" button.   A dialog box appears, asking the user 
to confirm deleting this particular individual.  The box can be dismissed by clicking either "OK" 
or "Cancel".  If the "OK" button is clicked, the entry in the address book for the selected person
is deleted, and the person's name is deleted from the list of names in the main window.  If the
"Cancel" button is clicked, no changes are made either to the address book or to the main window.

<a name="SortName">
<hr>

<h4>Sort Entries by Name Use Case</h4>

<p>
The Sort Entries by Name use case is initiated when the user clicks the Sort by Name button in 
the main window.  The entries in the address book are sorted alphabetically by name, and the list 
in the main window is updated to reflect this order as well.

<a name="SortZIP">
<hr>

<h4>Sort Entries by ZIP Use Case</h4>

<p>
The Sort Entries by ZIP use case is initiated when the user clicks the Sort by ZIP button in the 
main window.  The entries in the address book are sorted by zip code, and the list in the main 
window is updated to reflect this order as well.

<a name="Print">
<hr>

<h4>Print Entries Use Case</h4>

<p>
The Print Entries use case is initiated when the user chooses "Print" from the File menu. 
A save file dialog is displayed, and the user is allowed to choose a file to print the labels to.  
(If the user cancels the file dialog, the Print operation is canceled.)  The current contents of 
the address book are written out to the specified file (in their current order) in "mailing label"
format.  No information maintained by the program is changed.

</p>




<a name="New">
<hr>

<h4>Create New Address Book Use Case</h4>

<p>
The Create a New Address Book use case is initiated when the user chooses "New" from the File menu.
If the current address book contents have been changed since the last successful New, Open, Save, 
or Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... operation was done, the Offer to Save Changes extension is executed.  
Unless the user cancels the operation, a new empty address book is then created and replaces the
current address book.  This results in the list of names in the main window being  cleared, 
the current file becoming undefined, and the title of the main window becomes "Untitled".  
(NOTE: These conditions will also be in effect when the program initially starts up.)

</p>


<a name="Open">
<hr>

<h4>Open Existing Address Book Use Case</h4>

<p>
The Open Existing Address Book use case is initiated when the user chooses "Open" from the File menu.  
If the current address book contents have been changed since the last successful New, Open, Save,
or Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... operation was done, the Offer to Save Changes extension is executed.  
Unless the user cancels the operation, a load file dialog is displayed and the user is allowed 
to choose a file to open.   Once the user chooses a file, the current address book is replaced by the result 
of reading in the specified address book.   This results in the list of names in the main window 
being replaced by the names in the address book that was read, the file that was opened 
becoming the current file, and its name being displayed as the title of the main window.  
(If the user cancels the file dialog, or attempting to read the file results in an error, the 
current address book is left unchanged.  If the cancellation results from an error reading
the file, a dialog box is displayed warning the user of the error.)

</p>

 


<a name="Save">
<hr>

<h4>Save Address Book Use Case</h4>

<p>
The Save Address Book use case is initiated when the user chooses "Save" from the File menu. 
(The Save option is grayed out unless changes have been made to the address book since the 
last New, Open, Save, or Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... operation was done.)  If there is a current file, the current 
address book is saved to this file.   (If attempting to write the file results in an error, a 
dialog box is displayed warning the user of the error.)  If there is no current file, the 
Save Address Book As .. use case is done instead.  In all cases, the current address book and 
window list are left unchanged.

</p>




<a name="SaveAs">
<hr>

<h4>Save Address Book As ... Use Case</h4>

<p>
The Save Address Book As ... use case is initiated when the user chooses "Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;..."  from the File 
menu.  (The Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... option is always available.)  A save file dialog is displayed and the user 
is allowed to choose the name of a file in which to save the address book.  (If the user cancels 
the file dialog, the Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... operation is canceled.)     The current address book is saved to 
the specified file, and the file to which it was saved becomes the current file and its name is 
displayed as the title of the main window.   (If attempting to write the file results in an error, 
a dialog box is displayed warning the user of the error, and the current file and main window title
are unchanged.)  In all cases, the current address book and window list are left unchanged.

</p>





<a name="Quit">
<hr>

<h4>Quit Program Use Case</h4>

<p>
The Quit Program use case is initiated when the user chooses "Quit" from the File menu, or clicks
the close box for the main window.  In either case, if the current address book contents have
been changed since the last New, Open, Save, or Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... operation was done, the 
Offer to Save Changes extension is executed.   Unless the user cancels the operation, the
program is terminated.
</p>

</p>






<a name="SaveChanges">
<hr>

<h4>Offer to Save Changes Extension</h4>

<p>
The Offer to Save Changes extension is initiated from within the Create New Address Book, Open Existing
Address Book, or Quit program use cases, if the current address book has been changed since the last successful
New, Open, Save, or Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... operation was done.  A dialog box is displayed, informing the user
that there are unsaved changes, and asking the user whether to save changes, not save changes, or 
cancel the operation.  If the user chooses to save changes, the Save Address Book Use Case is executed
(which may result in executing the Save Address Book As ... Use Case if there is no current file). 
If the user chooses not to save changes, the original operation is simply resumed.  If the user chooses
to cancel (or cancels the save file dialog if one is needed), the original operation is canceled.
